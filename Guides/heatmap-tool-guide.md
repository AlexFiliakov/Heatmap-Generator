Example data structure:
```
Partner,Region,Performance Score
Partner A,North,85
Partner B,South,72
Partner C,North,91
```

- The tool will show a success message with the number of rows loaded

### 3. Configure Your Heatmap

#### Select Your Data Fields:
- **X-Axis (Columns)**: What appears across the top (e.g., Regions, Time Periods)
- **Y-Axis (Rows)**: What appears down the side (e.g., Partners, Products)
- **Heatmap Values**: The numbers that determine the colors (e.g., Performance Score, ROI)

#### Customize Appearance:
- **Chart Title**: Give your heatmap a descriptive title
- **Color Scheme**: Choose from 6 professional color palettes
  - Red-Yellow-Green: Best for performance metrics
  - Blues: Professional corporate look
  - Others: Scientific or high-contrast options

#### Set Thresholds:
- **Low Threshold**: Below this = poor performance (first color)
- **High Threshold**: Above this = good performance (third color)
- Values in between show as the middle color

### 4. Export Your Heatmap

- **Update Heatmap**: Apply your changes and preview
- **Download as PNG**: Creates a 300 DPI image perfect for PowerPoint
- **Export Embed**: Creates a standalone HTML file you can share

## Understanding the Color Settings

### Three-Color System
Instead of a gradient, the tool uses three distinct colors:
1. **First Color** (e.g., Red): Poor performance
2. **Middle Color** (e.g., Yellow): Average performance  
3. **Third Color** (e.g., Green): Good performance

### Thresholds Explained
- If you set thresholds at 0.3 and 0.7:
  - 0.0 - 0.3 = First color (poor)
  - 0.3 - 0.7 = Middle color (average)
  - 0.7 - 1.0 = Third color (good)

### Normalization
- **Checked** (Recommended): Scales all values to 0-1 for fair comparison
- **Unchecked**: Uses raw values from your data

## Tips for Great Heatmaps

### Data Organization
- **Limit categories**: 10-20 items per axis works best
- **Clean data**: Remove blanks and "N/A" values in Excel first
- **Consistent formatting**: Ensure numbers are formatted consistently

### Visual Best Practices
- **Title**: Be specific - "Q4 2024 Partner Performance by Region"
- **Color choice**: 
  - Use Red-Yellow-Green for metrics where high is good
  - Use Blues for neutral data
  - Consider colorblind-friendly options for public presentations

### PowerPoint Integration
1. Click "Download as PNG (300 DPI)"
2. In PowerPoint: Insert â†’ Pictures â†’ From File
3. Resize as needed (high resolution ensures quality)
4. Add annotations with PowerPoint text boxes

## Troubleshooting

### "No valid data to display"
- Check that your selected columns contain numeric values
- Remove any text (except headers) from value columns
- Ensure no blank rows in your data

### Colors look wrong
- Verify your threshold settings make sense for your data
- Try normalizing the data if comparing different scales
- Check if low values should be good (like costs) - you may need to interpret colors differently

### File won't upload
- Ensure it's a .CSV file (not .XLSX)
- Save Excel files as "CSV (Comma delimited)"
- Check file isn't open in Excel
